# Cross Product Calculator

Simple and fast cross product calculator. No ads, no server requests, only cross products.

## Install

Run `install.bat` or use the following command in the root directory.

```sh
npm i
```

## Run

Run `cross-product.bat` or use the following command in the `/src` directory.

```sh
node index
```

I recommend creating a shortcut for `cross-product.bat` to get easy access to the calculator.
